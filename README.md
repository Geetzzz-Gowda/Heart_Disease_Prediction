Heart_Disease_Prediction
This project is focused on predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on various patient health metrics. Using a dataset typically sourced from public health records, such as the UCI Heart Disease dataset, the project involves preprocessing the data by cleaning, handling missing values, and scaling features to ensure the KNN algorithm performs optimally. The KNN algorithm, a simple yet powerful supervised learning technique, classifies new patient data by comparing it with the closest neighbors in the dataset. The model is trained to recognize patterns in health indicators like age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and maximum heart rate. By tuning the number of neighbors (k) and using techniques like cross-validation, the model is evaluated for accuracy and reliability using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. This project highlights how machine learning can assist in early diagnosis and decision-making in healthcare, potentially aiding in the early detection of heart disease and improving patient outcomes.
